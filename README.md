# Optimization-in-Machine-Learning

Let's train a range of machine learning models and optimization tools that are used to apply train models below:
• ML models (deep neural networks, logistic regression, SVM, kernel methods)
• Convex optimization, convexity and nonsmooth calcu- lus tools for optimization
• Rates of convergence
• Subgradient methods, proximal gradient methods
• Accelarated gradient methods (momentum)
• Stochastic gradient methods
• Noise reduction methods (SVRG/SAGA/SARAH)
• Adaptive SGD methods (ADAM, Adagrad)
